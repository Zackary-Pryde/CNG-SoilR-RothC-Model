# CNG-SoilR-RothC-Model

This is the approach for modelling soil organic carbon (SOC) in agricultural lands. The modelling aims to quantify changes in SOC in response to a range of improved agricultural land management practices. 

The Rothamsted Carbon Model is implemented in the R-package *Soil-R*, originally released in Sierra et al. [2012](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/5/1045/2012/). The approach has been applied and implemented extensively in research to investigate changes in SOC, including in agricultural settings and under different land management practices. 

*SoilR* (v.1.2.105) is a modelling framework that contains a collection of functions for modelling SOM decomposition in the R-programming environment. 
*SoilR* was developed for R to provide simple access of SOM models in an open-source platform where the code is freely accessible. It is an open source tool and the package can be downloaded from the CRAN repository - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SoilR/index.html.
The package is published under a GPL-3 license and may therefore be run for all purposes - including commercial purposes and as a tool for creating proprietary software.
